			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p class="indiv">Woof! My name is Hera. I came into my parents lifes to help them move along after losing Igor. I am Maki's best friend and we love agriculture. We point out mistakes by uprooting most new planted stuff. Also, we are fitness trainers for the cats. We chase them around to keep them fit as they tend to eat too much. On that note, we think we should receive their portions too.</p>
