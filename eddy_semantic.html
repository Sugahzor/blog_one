			<p class="indiv">Good day. My name is King Edward. I am royalty and live with my subjects in the city home. I adore my mommy and follow her around everywhere, unless I am sleeping. And as you can see, I sleep in every and any position, as it best suits my royal needs. I also throw a fit and meow non-stop if my mommy doesn't caress/feed me when I ask for it. I am much loved, as I deserve of course.</p>
